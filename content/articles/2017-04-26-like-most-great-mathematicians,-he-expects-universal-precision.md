From the [Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin](http://amzn.to/2qe0hRp):

> [Thomas Godfrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Godfrey_(inventor)), a self-taught mathematician, great in his way, and afterward inventor of what is now called Hadley's Quadrant. But he knew little out of his way, and was not a pleasing companion; as, like most great mathematicians I have met with, he expected universal precision in every-thing said, or was for ever denying or distinguishing upon trifles, to the disturbance of all conversation.

I'm a recovering Godfrey Precisionist.
