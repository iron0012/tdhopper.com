Title: The Incessant Commentary on Being Tall
Category: Quote

Ralph Keyes, [The Height of Your Life](http://www.ralphkeyes.com/height/):

> I've heard this sort of thing repeatedly from tall men. It's not the incessant commentary about their height that is so annoying, it's the stupefying boredom of it all. Were anyone to say something original or witty or different in any way, the constant chatter thrown their way might at least be entertaining. But soon after reaching their full height, tall people realize to their horror that the lifetime's commentary to which they've been sentenced comes mostly from those with least to say.
